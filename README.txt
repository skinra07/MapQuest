Instructions:

1) I used Visual Studio 2015 to develop and build.

2) It reguires input csv file as an argument to run. This zip folder contains 
   POIs.csv as input file.

3) I put comments in the code to convey my ideas and thoughts.

4) I used PIMPL design to convey function encapsulation. In this way,
Developer can update/improve the implementation of API without worrying about
breaking User Code. API being load(), calculate(), and display().

5) I approximately spend 4 hours on the problem.
